         The MCU needs to send frequency and waveform data to the A D9833 and send amplitude data to the MCP41010 digital potentiometer. The AD9833 and MCP41010 use a common data port and clock port, but with their own chip selects. This only requires 4 I/Os of the microcontroller. The AD9850 high-speed operational amplifier amplifies the output signal by 5 times. The module separates the original signal VOUT of the AD9833 and the amplified signal PGA for convenient use by the customer.
