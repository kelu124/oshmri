Hi, Thanks for your interest! I'm using a FST3253 for the mixer, and LTC6227 for the dual op-amp, but I used an LT6231 in the prototype and that worked fine. The PCB uses 74CBT3251 for the low-pass filter switching and a LTC6226 as an *optional* pre-amplifier. I have just uploaded the Schematic, Bill of Materials, and Gerbers.  The code (and loads more documentation) is on the github project https://github.com/dawsonjon/PicoRX and the wiki https://github.com/dawsonjon/PicoRX/wiki.  If anything is missing, or needs further explanation, please let me know. Thanks Jon
