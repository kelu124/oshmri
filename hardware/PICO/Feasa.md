Following the initial feasibility review, here is a detailed analysis of the project's feasibility, considering the key requirements for the RP2040 Pico software development, focusing on the RPScope project:



1. Event triggering ADC acquisition over 200us (ADC speed at 100msps):
- Feasibility: Medium to High
- Challenges: Achieving a 100msps sampling rate on RP2040 Pico could be a challenge due to its limitations on processing power and peripheral speeds.
- Possible Solutions: Utilize the Programmable I/O (PIO) to maximize the ADC sampling rate or consider using an external high-speed ADC to meet the required sampling rate.



2. Beginning of the acquisition triggers a logic sequence over three to eleven IOs with precise timing:
- Feasibility: High
- Challenges: Coordinating multiple IO pins and achieving precise timing.
- Possible Solutions: Leverage the dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor to manage operations in parallel and use the PIO in PIO assembly language to optimize IO operations and achieve the required precision.



3. During acquisition, setting a fast SPI DAC (MCP4811) values:
- Feasibility: High
- Challenges: Configuring the MCP4811 with RP2040 Pico while ensuring its fast response time during the ADC acquisition process.
- Possible Solutions: Utilizing the SPI peripheral on the RP2040 Pico to interact with the MCP4811 fast SPI DAC, making use of DMA transfers to optimize data exchange, and properly configuring the SPI communication parameters to ensure high-speed data transfer.



4. Reading the acquired data through the RP2040 USB:
- Feasibility: High
- Challenges: Implementing efficient USB data transfer and ensuring compatibility with various systems.
- Possible Solutions: Utilizing the USB device capabilities already built into the RP2040 Pico and developing a USB communication protocol that would work seamlessly with the target system for data exchange.



In conclusion, while there are some challenges associated with the project requirements, our detailed feasibility review suggests that the project is achievable. To address the identified challenges, we will utilize the RP2040's features such as dual-core processors, PIOs, and SPI peripherals, as well as explore external components where necessary.
